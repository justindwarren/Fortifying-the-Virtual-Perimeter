# Fortifying the Vitual Perimeter

## Objective

The goal of this lab was to design and implement a SIEM framework around a vulnerable honeypot to collect, analyze, and visually present security event data such as failed login attempts. The project leveraged Microsoft Azure services, including Azure Virtual Machines, Log Analytics Workspace, Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM), and Microsoft Defender, to centralize and monitor logs. Additionally, Windows PowerShell ISE was used to integrate a custom geolocation log via a GitHub script, enabling enhanced visibility into attack sources.


### Skills Learned

- Practical understanding of SIEM concepts through hands-on configuration and log analysis.
- Experience deploying and monitoring a honeypot to capture real-world attack activity.
- Proficiency in analyzing failed authentication attempts and security events within Microsoft Sentinel.
- Hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure security services, including Virtual Machines, Log Analytics Workspace, and Defender.
- Ability to enrich security logs with geolocation data using PowerShell and custom scripts.
- Improved skills in identifying attack patterns and correlating security events.
- Strengthened troubleshooting, critical thinking, and investigative skills in a cloud-based security environment.

### Tools Used

- Cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Microsoft Sentinel for log ingestion, correlation, and analysis.
- Cloud infrastructure and virtualization tools through Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
- Centralized logging and monitoring tools using Azure Log Analytics Workspace.
- Endpoint and cloud security monitoring tools via Microsoft Defender.
- Scripting and automation tools using Windows PowerShell ISE for custom log creation and enrichment.
- Threat intelligence and visualization tools for analyzing authentication failures and geolocation-based attack data.
